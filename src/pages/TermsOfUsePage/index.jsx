        <p className="text-base">4. API Key Usage</p>
        <p className="text-base">
          At Cipher Labs, we take your privacy and the security of your data
          very seriously. As part of our services, we may need to utilise your
          API keys to deliver certain functionalities, such as accessing your
          Trading Journal information and providing relevant analytics.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base">
          When you provide your API keys, they are used strictly to interact
          with your account on the respective blockchain or trading platform, to
          fetch information about your trades, and to display your trading
          statistics on our platform. These keys are not stored or recorded on
          our servers in any form.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base">
          We assure you that the API keys you provide are utilised in a
          read-only mode. This means they are not capable of executing trades,
          making withdrawals, or performing any other transactional operations.
          Their function is strictly limited to fetching information necessary
          for the trading journal feature of our platform. In the unlikely event
          that these API keys are obtained by an unauthorised party, the risk is
          limited to that party's ability to view or close your trades. However,
          we have implemented robust security measures to prevent such an
          occurrence. It is important to understand that you retain control over
          these API keys and can revoke them anytime from the respective
          blockchain or trading platform.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base">
          Please ensure that you only enter your API keys in the designated
          areas on our website and that you never share them via email or other
          means. Remember, our staff will never ask you for your API keys. By
          providing us with your API keys, you agree to their use as described
          above. If you do not agree with or feel uncomfortable with this usage,
          you may choose not to use the specific features that require your API
          keys.

          Cipher Labs, Inc. offers its Services on an “as is” and “as available”
          basis. Other than what is expressly stated in these Terms, no explicit
          promises about the Services, their functionality, reliability,
          quality, availability, suitability to meet your specific needs or

          Furthermore, all results stemming from hypothetical, simulated
          performance tests and quantitative modelling inherently bear

          the trades have not been executed, the outcomes may over- or
          under-compensate for the impact of certain market factors, such as
          lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs and quantitative
          analysis, in general, are designed with the benefit of hindsight.
          Therefore, no representation is being made that any account will or is

          Investing in securities and/or crypto assets is highly risky. You may

          These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
          of the State of New South Wales, Australia, without giving effect to
          any principles of conflicts of law. You agree to the personal
          jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in Sydney,
          New South Wales, Australia, and waive any objection to such
          jurisdiction or venue.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base">
          The foregoing provision may not apply to you depending on the laws in
          your jurisdiction. This Governing Law section shall survive any
          termination of your use of the Cipher Labs Services.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base">
          In the event that Cipher Labs may lawfully exclude any implied
          conditions or warranties to the extent permissible by law, we
          expressly disclaim any liability for breach of those conditions or
          warranties. In jurisdictions where exclusions for implied conditions
          or warranties are not allowed, Cipher Labs' liability will at all
          times be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

          In the event of a dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms,
          including any question regarding its existence, validity, or
          termination, the parties shall first seek settlement of that dispute
          by mediation in accordance with the Australian Centre for
          International Commercial Arbitration (ACICA) Mediation Rules, which
          are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base">
          If the dispute is not settled by mediation within 30 days of the
          commencement of the mediation, or such further period as the parties
          shall agree in writing, the dispute shall be referred to and finally
          resolved by arbitration under the ACICA Arbitration Rules. The
          arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator, to be appointed
          by the Chairman of ACICA. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration,
          shall be Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base">
          The language to be used in the mediation and the arbitration shall be
          English. The governing law of these Terms shall be the substantive law
          of New South Wales, Australia. Judgment upon the award rendered by the
          arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

          Please note that this dispute resolution provision does not preclude
          you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local
          agencies. These agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief on your
          behalf.

          Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms, we agree that if we make
          any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change
          to any notice address, website link, or telephone number provided
          herein), that change will not apply to any dispute of which we had
          written notice on the effective date of the change.
